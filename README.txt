To start with, add example(s) of
1. Semaphore
2. Future
3. Executors
4. CountDownLatch
5. ForkJoin
6. ConcurrentHashMap


We can write a problem statement here and try to solve it and finally take a look at best solution.

Problem Statements:
1. We have X (say 4) thread and trying to print counting expectation is
    t1 -> 1
    t2 -> 2
    t3 -> 3
    t4 -> 4
    t1 -> 5
    t2 -> 6 and so on.. other threads should wait until there turn comes
